### What am I working on?
	* A IOT management app with accounts and real time data collection using MQTT
	* A machine learning expiriment with placments of POI on medical images
	* A project that aims to ease deployment across multiple platforms (More details eventually)
	* A book
	
	`As you can see, I currently have several projects up in the air. Between the lot and schooling I have very little time to take on any new projects, but am always open to help out where I can.`
	
### What am I trying to learn?
`Recently I have been working on, and learning about API creation. I'm very intrested in IOT type projects and the issues that tend to come up when trying to deal with a large number of devices. 
In the same vein, I have since been drawn to machine learning as a way of taking some of this IOT data and drawing meaningful conclusions from it. As of now these are my two main areas of interest.`

### Need Help?
`If you have a project that aligns with some of my interests, and can act as a good learning opportunity please reach out`
