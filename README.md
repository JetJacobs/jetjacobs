### Hello
I'm Jet Jacobs. I'm currently attending my Senior in software engineering at Iowa State University. 

### What am I working on?
* A IOT management app with accounts and real time data collection using MQTT
* A machine learning expiriment with placments of POI on medical images
* A project that aims to ease deployment across multiple platforms (More details eventually)
* A book
	
As you can see, I currently have several projects up in the air. Between the lot and schooling I have very little time to take on any new projects, but am always open to help out where I can.
	
### What am I trying to learn?
Recently I have been working on, and learning about API creation. I'm very intrested in IOT type projects and the issues that tend to come up when trying to deal with a large number of devices. 
In the same vein, I have since been drawn to machine learning as a way of taking some of this IOT data and drawing meaningful conclusions from it. As of now these are my two main areas of interest.
